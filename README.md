OpenSCAD generating seamless, friction-fit lens gears for follow focus.
If you just want something you can print, I have made 100 .STL files with internal diameters between 50-100mm, which can currently be accessed [on dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cs3p9jzog45123o/Lens%20Gear%20for%20Follow%20Focus%20-%20Seamless%20Friction%20Fit%2050-100mm%20and%20SCAD%20generator.zip?dl=0))
